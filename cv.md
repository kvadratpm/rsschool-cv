IT-teacher.
I teach other people and study on my own constantly.
At the same time I am a network engineer.
I am interested in programming in JavaScript and Python.
I love to learn and gain new knowledge.
I chose the front-end as the direction of my further development.
In my education, I pursue the goal of changing the direction of my activity and engaging in programming. 
But I also want to continue to pass my knowledge to other people not leaving the teaching.
